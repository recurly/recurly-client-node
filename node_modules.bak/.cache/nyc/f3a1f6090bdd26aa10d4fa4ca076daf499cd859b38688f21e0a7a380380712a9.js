 * UsageCreate
 * @typedef {Object} UsageCreate
 * @prop {number} amount - The amount of usage. Can be positive, negative, or 0. No decimals allowed, we will strip them. If the usage-based add-on is billed with a percentage, your usage will be a monetary amount you will want to format in cents. (e.g., $5.00 is "500").
 * @prop {string} merchantTag - Custom field for recording the id in your own system associated with the usage, so you can provide auditable usage displays to your customers using a GET on this endpoint.
 * @prop {Date} recordingTimestamp - When the usage was recorded in your system.
 * @prop {Date} usageTimestamp - When the usage actually happened. This will define the line item dates this usage is billed under and is important for revenue recognition.
