 * CouponCreate

 * @prop {boolean} appliesToNonPlanCharges - The coupon is valid for one-time, non-plan charges if true.
 * @prop {string} code - The code the customer enters to redeem the coupon.

 * @prop {number} discountPercent - The percent of the price discounted by the coupon.  Required if `discount_type` is `percent`.
 * @prop {string} discountType - The type of discount provided by the coupon (how the amount discounted is calculated)
 * @prop {string} duration - This field does not apply when the discount_type is `free_trial`. - "single_use" coupons applies to the first invoice only. - "temporal" coupons will apply to invoices for the duration determined by the `temporal_unit` and `temporal_amount` attributes. - "forever" coupons will apply to invoices forever.
 * @prop {number} freeTrialAmount - Sets the duration of time the `free_trial_unit` is for. Required if `discount_type` is `free_trial`.

 * @prop {string} invoiceDescription - Description of the coupon on the invoice.
 * @prop {number} maxRedemptions - A maximum number of redemptions for the coupon. The coupon will expire when it hits its maximum redemptions.
 * @prop {number} maxRedemptionsPerAccount - Redemptions per account is the number of times a specific account can redeem the coupon. Set redemptions per account to `1` if you want to keep customers from gaming the system and getting more than one discount from the coupon campaign.
 * @prop {string} name - The internal name for the coupon.
 * @prop {Array.<string>} planCodes - List of plan codes to which this coupon applies. Required if `applies_to_all_plans` is false. Overrides `applies_to_all_plans` when `applies_to_all_plans` is true.
 * @prop {string} redeemByDate - The date and time the coupon will expire and can no longer be redeemed. Time is always 11:59:59, the end-of-day Pacific time.
 * @prop {string} redemptionResource - Whether the discount is for all eligible charges on the account, or only a specific subscription.
 * @prop {number} temporalAmount - If `duration` is "temporal" than `temporal_amount` is an integer which is multiplied by `temporal_unit` to define the duration that the coupon will be applied to invoices for.
 * @prop {string} temporalUnit - If `duration` is "temporal" than `temporal_unit` is multiplied by `temporal_amount` to define the duration that the coupon will be applied to invoices for.
 * @prop {string} uniqueCodeTemplate - On a bulk coupon, the template from which unique coupon codes are generated. - You must start the template with your coupon_code wrapped in single quotes. - Outside of single quotes, use a 9 for a character that you want to be a random number. - Outside of single quotes, use an "x" for a character that you want to be a random letter. - Outside of single quotes, use an * for a character that you want to be a random number or letter. - Use single quotes ' ' for characters that you want to remain static. These strings can be alphanumeric and may contain a - _ or +. For example: "'abc-'****'-def'"
