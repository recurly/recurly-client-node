 * SubscriptionChangeCreate
 * @typedef {Object} SubscriptionChangeCreate
 * @prop {Array.<SubscriptionAddOnUpdate>} addOns - If this value is omitted your existing add-ons will be removed. If you provide a value for this field it will replace any existing add-ons. So, when adding or modifying an add-on, you need to include the existing subscription add-ons. Unchanged add-ons can be included just using the subscription add-on's ID: `{"id": "abc123"}`.  If a subscription add-on's `code` is supplied without the `id`, `{"code": "def456"}`, the subscription add-on attributes will be set to the current values of the plan add-on unless provided in the request.  - If an `id` is passed, any attributes not passed in will pull from the   existing subscription add-on - If a `code` is passed, any attributes not passed in will pull from the   current values of the plan add-on - Attributes passed in as part of the request will override either of the   above scenarios
 * @prop {string} collectionMethod - Collection method
 * @prop {Array.<string>} couponCodes - A list of coupon_codes to be redeemed on the subscription during the change. Only allowed if timeframe is now and you change something about the subscription that creates an invoice.
 * @prop {Array.<CustomField>} customFields - The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
 * @prop {number} netTerms - Integer representing the number of days after an invoice's creation that the invoice will become past due. If an invoice's net terms are set to '0', it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after itâ€™s created. If an invoice is due net 30, it will become past due at 31 days exactly.
 * @prop {string} planCode - If you want to change to a new plan, you can provide the plan's code or id. If both are provided the `plan_id` will be used.
 * @prop {string} planId - If you want to change to a new plan, you can provide the plan's code or id. If both are provided the `plan_id` will be used.
 * @prop {string} poNumber - For manual invoicing, this identifies the PO number associated with the subscription.
 * @prop {number} quantity - Optionally override the default quantity of 1.
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {SubscriptionChangeShippingCreate} shipping - The shipping address can currently only be changed immediately, using SubscriptionUpdate.
 * @prop {string} timeframe - The timeframe parameter controls when the upgrade or downgrade takes place. The subscription change can occur now, when the subscription is next billed, or when the subscription term ends. Generally, if you're performing an upgrade, you will want the change to occur immediately (now). If you're performing a downgrade, you should set the timeframe to `term_end` or `bill_date` so the change takes effect at a scheduled billing date. The `renewal` timeframe option is accepted as an alias for `term_end`.
 * @prop {string} transactionType - An optional type designation for the payment gateway transaction created by this request. Supports 'moto' value, which is the acronym for mail order and telephone transactions.
 * @prop {number} unitAmount - Optionally, sets custom pricing for the subscription, overriding the plan's default unit amount. The subscription's current currency will be used.
