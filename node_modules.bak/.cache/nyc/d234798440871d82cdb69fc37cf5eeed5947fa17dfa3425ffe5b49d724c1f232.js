 * SubscriptionPurchase
 * @typedef {Object} SubscriptionPurchase
 * @prop {Array.<SubscriptionAddOnCreate>} addOns - Add-ons
 * @prop {boolean} autoRenew - Whether the subscription renews at the end of its term.
 * @prop {Array.<CustomField>} customFields - The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
 * @prop {Date} nextBillDate - If present, this sets the date the subscription's next billing period will start (`current_period_ends_at`). This can be used to align the subscriptionâ€™s billing to a specific day of the month. The initial invoice will be prorated for the period between the subscription's activation date and the billing period end date. Subsequent periods will be based off the plan interval. For a subscription with a trial period, this will change when the trial expires.
 * @prop {string} planCode - Plan code
 * @prop {string} planId - Plan ID
 * @prop {number} quantity - Optionally override the default quantity of 1.
 * @prop {number} renewalBillingCycles - If `auto_renew=true`, when a term completes, `total_billing_cycles` takes this value as the length of subsequent terms. Defaults to the plan's `total_billing_cycles`.
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {SubscriptionShippingPurchase} shipping - Create a shipping address on the account and assign it to the subscription.
 * @prop {Date} startsAt - If set, the subscription will begin in the future on this date. The subscription will apply the setup fee and trial period, unless the plan has no trial.
 * @prop {number} totalBillingCycles - The number of cycles/billing periods in a term. When `remaining_billing_cycles=0`, if `auto_renew=true` the subscription will renew and a new term will begin, otherwise the subscription will expire.
 * @prop {Date} trialEndsAt - If set, overrides the default trial behavior for the subscription. The date must be in the future.
 * @prop {number} unitAmount - Override the unit amount of the subscription plan by setting this value in cents. If not provided, the subscription will inherit the price from the subscription plan for the provided currency.
