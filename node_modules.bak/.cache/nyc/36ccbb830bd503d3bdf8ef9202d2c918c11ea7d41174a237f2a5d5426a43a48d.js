 * SubscriptionUpdate
 * @typedef {Object} SubscriptionUpdate
 * @prop {boolean} autoRenew - Whether the subscription renews at the end of its term.
 * @prop {string} collectionMethod - Change collection method
 * @prop {Array.<CustomField>} customFields - The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
 * @prop {string} customerNotes - Specify custom notes to add or override Customer Notes. Custom notes will stay with a subscription on all renewals.
 * @prop {number} netTerms - Integer representing the number of days after an invoice's creation that the invoice will become past due. If an invoice's net terms are set to '0', it is due 'On Receipt' and will become past due 24 hours after it’s created. If an invoice is due net 30, it will become past due at 31 days exactly.
 * @prop {Date} nextBillDate - If present, this sets the date the subscription's next billing period will start (`current_period_ends_at`). This can be used to align the subscription’s billing to a specific day of the month. For a subscription in a trial period, this will change when the trial expires. This parameter is useful for postponement of a subscription to change its billing date without proration.
 * @prop {string} poNumber - For manual invoicing, this identifies the PO number associated with the subscription.
 * @prop {number} remainingBillingCycles - The remaining billing cycles in the current term.
 * @prop {number} renewalBillingCycles - If `auto_renew=true`, when a term completes, `total_billing_cycles` takes this value as the length of subsequent terms. Defaults to the plan's `total_billing_cycles`.
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {SubscriptionShippingUpdate} shipping - Subscription shipping details
 * @prop {string} termsAndConditions - Specify custom notes to add or override Terms and Conditions. Custom notes will stay with a subscription on all renewals.
