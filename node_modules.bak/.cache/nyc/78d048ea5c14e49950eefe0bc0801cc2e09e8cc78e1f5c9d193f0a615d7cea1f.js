 * SubscriptionAddOnCreate
 * @typedef {Object} SubscriptionAddOnCreate
 * @prop {string} addOnSource - Used to determine where the associated add-on data is pulled from. If this value is set to `plan_add_on` or left blank, then add_on data will be pulled from the plan's add-ons. If the associated `plan` has `allow_any_item_on_subscriptions` set to `true` and this field is set to `item`, then the associated add-on data will be pulled from the site's item catalog.
 * @prop {string} code - If `add_on_source` is set to `plan_add_on` or left blank, then plan's add-on `code` should be used. If `add_on_source` is set to `item`, then the `code` from the associated item should be used.
 * @prop {number} quantity - Quantity
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {Array.<SubscriptionAddOnTier>} tiers - If the plan add-on's `tier_type` is `flat`, then `tiers` must be absent. The `tiers` object must include one to many tiers with `ending_quantity` and `unit_amount`. There must be one tier with an `ending_quantity` of 999999999 which is the default if not provided. See our [Guide](https://developers.recurly.com/guides/item-addon-guide.html) for an overview of how to configure quantity-based pricing models.
 * @prop {number} unitAmount - * Optionally, override the add-on's default unit amount. * If the plan add-on's `tier_type` is `tiered`, `volume`, or `stairstep`, then `unit_amount` must be absent.
 * @prop {number} usagePercentage - The percentage taken of the monetary amount of usage tracked. This can be up to 4 decimal places. A value between 0.0 and 100.0. Required if `add_on_type` is usage and `usage_type` is percentage. Must be omitted otherwise. `usage_percentage` does not support tiers. See our [Guide](https://developers.recurly.com/guides/usage-based-billing-guide.html) for an overview of how to configure usage add-ons.
