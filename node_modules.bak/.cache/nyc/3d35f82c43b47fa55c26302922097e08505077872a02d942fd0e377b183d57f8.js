 * SubscriptionAddOnUpdate
 * @typedef {Object} SubscriptionAddOnUpdate
 * @prop {string} addOnSource - Used to determine where the associated add-on data is pulled from. If this value is set to `plan_add_on` or left blank, then add_on data will be pulled from the plan's add-ons. If the associated `plan` has `allow_any_item_on_subscriptions` set to `true` and this field is set to `item`, then the associated add-on data will be pulled from the site's item catalog.
 * @prop {string} code - If a code is provided without an id, the subscription add-on attributes will be set to the current value for those attributes on the plan add-on unless provided in the request. If `add_on_source` is set to `plan_add_on` or left blank, then plan's add-on `code` should be used. If `add_on_source` is set to `item`, then the `code` from the associated item should be used.
 * @prop {string} id - When an id is provided, the existing subscription add-on attributes will persist unless overridden in the request.
 * @prop {number} quantity - Quantity
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {Array.<SubscriptionAddOnTier>} tiers - If the plan add-on's `tier_type` is `flat`, then `tiers` must be absent. The `tiers` object must include one to many tiers with `ending_quantity` and `unit_amount`. There must be one tier with an `ending_quantity` of 999999999 which is the default if not provided.
 * @prop {number} unitAmount - Optionally, override the add-on's default unit amount.
 * @prop {number} usagePercentage - The percentage taken of the monetary amount of usage tracked. This can be up to 4 decimal places. A value between 0.0 and 100.0. Required if add_on_type is usage and usage_type is percentage.
