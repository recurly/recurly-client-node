/**
 * Plan
 * @typedef {Object} Plan
 * @prop {string} accountingCode - Accounting code for invoice line items for the plan. If no value is provided, it defaults to plan's code.
 * @prop {boolean} allowAnyItemOnSubscriptions - Used to determine whether items can be assigned as add-ons to individual subscriptions. If `true`, items can be assigned as add-ons to individual subscription add-ons. If `false`, only plan add-ons can be used.
 * @prop {boolean} autoRenew - Subscriptions will automatically inherit this value once they are active. If `auto_renew` is `true`, then a subscription will automatically renew its term at renewal. If `auto_renew` is `false`, then a subscription will expire at the end of its term. `auto_renew` can be overridden on the subscription record itself.
 * @prop {number} avalaraServiceType - Used by Avalara for Communications taxes. The transaction type in combination with the service type describe how the plan is taxed. Refer to [the documentation](https://help.avalara.com/AvaTax_for_Communications/Tax_Calculation/AvaTax_for_Communications_Tax_Engine/Mapping_Resources/TM_00115_AFC_Modules_Corresponding_Transaction_Types) for more available t/s types.
 * @prop {number} avalaraTransactionType - Used by Avalara for Communications taxes. The transaction type in combination with the service type describe how the plan is taxed. Refer to [the documentation](https://help.avalara.com/AvaTax_for_Communications/Tax_Calculation/AvaTax_for_Communications_Tax_Engine/Mapping_Resources/TM_00115_AFC_Modules_Corresponding_Transaction_Types) for more available t/s types.
 * @prop {string} code - Unique code to identify the plan. This is used in Hosted Payment Page URLs and in the invoice exports.
 * @prop {Date} createdAt - Created at
 * @prop {Array.<PlanPricing>} currencies - Pricing
 * @prop {Array.<CustomField>} customFields - The custom fields will only be altered when they are included in a request. Sending an empty array will not remove any existing values. To remove a field send the name with a null or empty value.
 * @prop {Date} deletedAt - Deleted at
 * @prop {string} description - Optional description, not displayed.
 * @prop {string} dunningCampaignId - Unique ID to identify a dunning campaign. Used to specify if a non-default dunning campaign should be assigned to this plan. For sites without multiple dunning campaigns enabled, the default dunning campaign will always be used.
 * @prop {PlanHostedPages} hostedPages - Hosted pages settings
 * @prop {string} id - Plan ID
 * @prop {number} intervalLength - Length of the plan's billing interval in `interval_unit`.
 * @prop {string} intervalUnit - Unit for the plan's billing interval.
 * @prop {string} name - This name describes your plan and will appear on the Hosted Payment Page and the subscriber's invoice.
 * @prop {string} object - Object type
 * @prop {string} pricingModel - A fixed pricing model has the same price for each billing period. A ramp pricing model defines a set of Ramp Intervals, where a subscription changes price on a specified cadence of billing periods. The price change could be an increase or decrease.
 * @prop {Array.<PlanRampInterval>} rampIntervals - Ramp Intervals
 * @prop {string} revenueScheduleType - Revenue schedule type
 * @prop {string} setupFeeAccountingCode - Accounting code for invoice line items for the plan's setup fee. If no value is provided, it defaults to plan's accounting code.
 * @prop {string} setupFeeRevenueScheduleType - Setup fee revenue schedule type
 * @prop {string} state - The current state of the plan.
 * @prop {string} taxCode - Used by Avalara, Vertex, and Recurly’s EU VAT tax feature. The tax code values are specific to each tax system. If you are using Recurly’s EU VAT feature you can use `unknown`, `physical`, or `digital`.
 * @prop {boolean} taxExempt - `true` exempts tax on the plan, `false` applies tax on the plan.
 * @prop {number} totalBillingCycles - Automatically terminate subscriptions after a defined number of billing cycles. Number of billing cycles before the plan automatically stops renewing, defaults to `null` for continuous, automatic renewal.
 * @prop {number} trialLength - Length of plan's trial period in `trial_units`. `0` means `no trial`.
 * @prop {boolean} trialRequiresBillingInfo - Allow free trial subscriptions to be created without billing info.
 * @prop {string} trialUnit - Units for the plan's trial period.
 * @prop {Date} updatedAt - Last updated at
