/**
 * Account
 * @typedef {Object} Account
 * @prop {Address} address

 * @prop {BillingInfo} billingInfo
 * @prop {string} ccEmails - Additional email address that should receive account correspondence. These should be separated only by commas. These CC emails will receive all emails that the `email` field also receives.

 * @prop {string} company
 * @prop {Date} createdAt - When the account was created.

 * @prop {Date} deletedAt - If present, when the account was last marked inactive.
 * @prop {string} dunningCampaignId - Unique ID to identify a dunning campaign. Used to specify if a non-default dunning campaign should be assigned to this account. For sites without multiple dunning campaigns enabled, the default dunning campaign will always be used.
 * @prop {string} email - The email address used for communicating with this customer. The customer will also use this email address to log into your hosted account management pages. This value does not need to be unique.
 * @prop {string} exemptionCertificate - The tax exemption certificate number for the account. If the merchant has an integration for the Vertex tax provider, this optional value will be sent in any tax calculation requests for the account.
 * @prop {string} firstName
 * @prop {boolean} hasActiveSubscription - Indicates if the account has an active subscription.
 * @prop {boolean} hasCanceledSubscription - Indicates if the account has a canceled subscription.

 * @prop {boolean} hasPastDueInvoice - Indicates if the account has a past due invoice.
 * @prop {boolean} hasPausedSubscription - Indicates if the account has a paused subscription.
 * @prop {string} hostedLoginToken - The unique token for automatically logging the account in to the hosted management pages. You may automatically log the user into their hosted management pages by directing the user to: `https://{subdomain}.recurly.com/account/{hosted_login_token}`.
 * @prop {string} id
 * @prop {string} lastName
 * @prop {string} object - Object type
 * @prop {string} parentAccountId - The UUID of the parent account associated with this account.

 * @prop {Array.<ShippingAddress>} shippingAddresses - The shipping addresses on the account.
 * @prop {string} state - Accounts can be either active or inactive.
 * @prop {boolean} taxExempt - The tax status of the account. `true` exempts tax on the account, `false` applies tax on the account.
 * @prop {Date} updatedAt - When the account was last changed.
 * @prop {string} username - A secondary value for the account.
 * @prop {string} vatNumber - The VAT number of the account (to avoid having the VAT applied). This is only used for manually collected invoices.
